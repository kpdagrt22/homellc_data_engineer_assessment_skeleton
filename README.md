# Data Engineering Assessment

Welcome! This exercise is designed to evaluate your core skills in **data engineering**:

- **SQL databases**: Data modeling, normalization, and scripting
- **Python and ETL**: Data cleaning, transformation, and loading workflows

---

## 📚 How This Document Works

Each section is structured with:

- **Problem:** Background and context for the task
- **Task:** What you are required to do (including any bonus “extra” tasks)
- **Solution:** Where you must document your approach, decisions, and provide instructions for reviewers

> **Tech Stack:**  
> Please use only Python (for ETL/data processing) and SQL/MySQL (for database).  
> Only use extra libraries if they do not replace core logic, and clearly explain your choices in your solution.

## 0. Setup

1. **Fork and clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/homellc_data_engineer_assessment_skeleton.git
    ```
2. **Start the MySQL database in Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.initial.yml up --build -d
    ```
    - Database is available on `localhost:3306`
    - Credentials/configuration are in the Docker Compose file
    - **Do not change** database name or credentials

3. For MySQL Docker image reference:  
   [MySQL Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)

### Problem

You are provided with property-related data in a CSV file.
- Each row relates to a property.
- There are multiple Columns related to this property.
- The database is not normalized and lacks relational structure.


### Task

- **Normalize the data:**
  - Develop a Python ETL script to read, clean, transform, and load   data into your normalized MySQL tables.
  - Refer the field config document for the relation of business logic
  - Use primary keys and foreign keys to properly capture relationships

- **Deliverable:**
  - Write necessary python and sql scripts
  - Place the scripts inside the `sql/` directory)
  - The scripts should take the initial csv to your final, normalized schema when executed
  - Clearly document how to run your script, dependencies, and how it integrates with your database.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python (include a `requirements.txt`)
Use **MySQL** and SQL for all database work  
- You may use any CLI or GUI for development, but the final changes must be submitted as python/ SQL scripts 
- **Do not** use ORM migrations—write all SQL by hand

### Solution

> **Document your database design and solution here:**  
> - Explain your schema and any design decisions  
> - Give clear instructions on how to run and test your script

> **Document your ETL logic here:**  
> - Outline your approach and design  
> - Provide instructions and code snippets for running the ETL  
> - List any requirements

## Submission Guidelines

- Edit this README with your solutions and instructions for each section
- Place all scripts/code in their respective folders (`sql/`, `scripts/`, etc.)
- Ensure all steps are fully **reproducible** using your documentation

**Good luck! We look forward to your submission.**
